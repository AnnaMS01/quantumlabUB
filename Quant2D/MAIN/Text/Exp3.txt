>POTENTIAL:
   Centered square barrier half the size of the screen.
   The potential value is the same in every edge of the square being
   five times the energy of the wave function and zero in the other 
   points.


>INITIAL WAVE FUNCTION:
   Centered gaussian that fits into the square of the potential.


>EVOLUTION:
   The wave function will expand until sees the square.
   Even when the barrier is higher than the wave function, it can escape
   and exists the probability of measuring it outside the box.
