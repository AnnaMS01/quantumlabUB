>POTENTIAL:
   Centered square barrier half the size of the screen.
   The potential value is the same in every edge of the square being
   fifty times the energy of the wave function and zero in the other 
   points.


>INITIAL WAVE FUNCTION:
   Centered gaussian that fits into the square of the potential.


>EVOLUTION:
   The wave function will expand until sees the square.
   The barrier is much higher than the wave function and it can barely
   escape. The probability of measuring it outside the box is much lower
   but it is still possible.
