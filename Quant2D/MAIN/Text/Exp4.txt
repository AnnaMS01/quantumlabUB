>POTENTIAL:
   Harmonic oscillator type of potential with different frequency in
   each axis.


>INITIAL WAVE FUNCTION:
   Centered ground eigenstate relative to an harmonic oscillator potential
   with same frequancy in both axis and equal to the x axis of the 
   actual potential.


>EVOLUTION:
   The wave function will pulsate with different frequences in each direction
   and without moving its center.
