The source of the photons is a violet diode laser. It 
also consists of a collimating lens, a blue filter and 
a linear polarizer in order to fine tune the experiment, 
increase countings and avoid noise.

The downconversion crystals consist of two 
Beta-Barium-Borate (BBO) crystals. One crystal 
is rotated 90 degrees from the other because each 
one can only downconvert one pump polarization and 
the other polarization passes through unchanged. 
Either one can downconvert a vertical or horizontal 
pump into two horizontal or vertical idler-signal pair
of photons respectively.

The quartz sheet is used to induce a known phase to 
one polarization. It is placed between the laser and 
the crystals.

Linear polarizers block all the light which is not 
polarized along a given axis. The downconverted 
photons from the crystals are polarized in a combi-
nation of the vertical and horizontal states in respect
to the polarizer's axis, thus having a certain proba-
bility to pass through.

At the receiving end, immediatly behind the polari-
zers, the two Single Photon Counting Modules (SPCMs) 
are in charge of emmittig an electric pulse when a 
photon impacts them. These spikes are processed by 
a filtering circuit which decides weather or not 
the pair of photons detected are indeed entangled. 
Because the photons of a downconverted pair are pro-
duced at the same time they cause nearly simultaneous
firings of the SPCMs, in this case, a coincidence is 
recorded in a PC.
